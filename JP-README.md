# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Purpose of Project

This week's homework assignment required creation of an application to generate a random password based on the selection critera the user has selected. 

The password combination included various options for the user such as:

* Numeric symbols
* Special character symbols
* Uppercase Letters
* Lowercase Letters

## My experience with this assignment

I enjoyed this project as an introductory assignment into JavaScript. It was challenging but reasonable, I feel as if I understand the logic of the language better now as when I first started this assignment. The application runs smoothly with the JavaScript I added such as while loops, if else statements, general functions, prompts, and confirms.
